# Weather

Weather App Project developed for the Platzi "Manipulating DOM" course. The project is assigned without any detail on implementation.

## Project URL

## Project Description

Weather Application that uses the [Open Weather API](<(https://openweathermap.org/)>) to show current and forecast data. In the App you can look for any city, select a city from a predefined favorite list and add or remove from it new cities.

This app does not control user data or has a backend that stores its data, so all the cities added or removed from the favorite list will last only until you refresh the page.

## Main Objective

The intention of this project is to practice DOM Manipulation. Here you must fetch data from an API and present that information in a responsive layout. Additionally, the app enables de user to interact with a search bar to look for new cities and redefine a favorite cities list.

## Technologies used

This project was developed using HTML, CSS and JS Vanilla.

## Special Challenges

1. Fetch an API depending on the data you want to retrieve about certain city.
2. The app requieres a considerable amount of functions, so structuring the repository as clean and organized as possible is key for easy progression.
3. The app works around a few state variables. Proper function designing and their import/export as modules lets you control the whole app interactivity without much complexity.

## Key JavaScript Concepts Used

1. fetch()
2. append(), remove()
3. addEventListener()
4. modules
